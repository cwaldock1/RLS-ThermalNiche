# RLS-ThermalNiche
Analysis of realized thermal niche shape and abundance-performance relationships from Reef Life Survey community surveys. Scripts pre-processing data are not included (due to number of raster extractions etc..) but all scripts to run analyses and the processes data are provided in full (scripts-final). All data are available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7218104 on publication.
